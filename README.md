# TimeSeries Analysis 

# This Project
For this project, data was collected on various economic and environmental indicators from multiple countries since 1950. The key metrics include GDP per capita, corporate investment, industrial production, primary energy consumption, and CO2 emissions per capita. 

## Country Classification:
Two categories were established based on the implementation of carbon tax policies:
<br>
1. **Countries not implementing Carbon Tax**:
United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Germany, South Korea, Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates

<br>
2. **Countries implementing Carbon Tax**:
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom


## Aim
I used this data to answer the following questions.
 
- Research Question 

## Models 
- Exponential Smoothing
- SARIMAX
- Regression

## My Findings
1. Using exponential smoothing, future projections for U.S. CO2 emissions suggest a continuation of current trends in their reduction over time.
